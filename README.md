# burrito-masala
Website for fictional food cart.

Burrito Masala is the one page static website for a fictional food cart. The page is meant to convey to its users what food is being offered and how they can order it. 

This project was my first attempt at building a website from the ground up using the waterfall design method. The site uses mainly HTML and CSS, with a small amount of JavaScript.

Most notable features are its mobile first responsive design and Google Maps API.

Note: Due to being publically published, I have changed the API Key, so the API will not work.
